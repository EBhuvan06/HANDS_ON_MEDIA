# Hand Gesture MPV Control - Requirements
# Tested on NVIDIA Jetson Nano (JetPack 4.6, Ubuntu 18.04)
# Python 3.6+

# ==================== CORE DEPENDENCIES ====================

# Computer Vision
opencv-python>=4.5.0

# Hand Detection
mediapipe>=0.8.9

# Deep Learning - TFLite Inference
# NOTE for Jetson Nano: Install TensorFlow from NVIDIA wheel, not pip
# See docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md for Jetson-specific TF installation
tensorflow>=2.5.0

# Numerical Computing
numpy>=1.19.0

# ==================== JETSON NANO NOTES ====================
# Do NOT install tensorflow from pip on Jetson Nano
# Instead use NVIDIA's pre-built wheel:
#
# wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/jp/v46/tensorflow/tensorflow-2.5.0+nv21.8-cp36-cp36m-linux_aarch64.whl
# pip3 install tensorflow-2.5.0+nv21.8-cp36-cp36m-linux_aarch64.whl
#
# OpenCV and MediaPipe may also need special installation
# See docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md for full instructions

# ==================== STANDARD LIBRARY (no install needed) ====================
# socket      - MPV IPC communication (built-in)
# json        - Command serialization (built-in)
# time        - Performance timing (built-in)
# os          - File system checks (built-in)
# collections - deque for buffers (built-in)
